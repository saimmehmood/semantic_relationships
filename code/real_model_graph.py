### Real Model ###

# This code generates walks of trajectory paths based on cells ids. 
# It outputs trajectory paths as list of cell ids.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict

df = pd.read_csv('traj_as_cells_sample_10000.csv')

# Keeping distinct traj id's.
# As one traj ids appears multiple times.
# This helps us in storing all the cell id's
# against a single traj id i.e., the cells through
# which trajectory has passed.
