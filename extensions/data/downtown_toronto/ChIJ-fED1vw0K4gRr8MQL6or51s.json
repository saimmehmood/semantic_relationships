Each one of us gets a bench and were able to learn how to use the tools needed to turn a piece of metal into a beautiful ring. Sarah and Melissa also made sure all of us were able to do each step, and even if we hit a snag, they were able to rectify it. They also took pictures and made us some tea/coffee, which were a nice touch. We're very pleased with the resulting wedding bands and would love to come back again to make another set for our future anniversary gifts for each other. Thank you for the beautiful experience Melissa and Sarah!",

It made the ring so much more special and meaningful to me, knowing it was made by my fianc\u00e9 :) they\u2019re so knowledgeable and patient, we learned a lot and are so happy to get the exact rings we wanted :D thanks so much Devil\u2019s Workshop!",
