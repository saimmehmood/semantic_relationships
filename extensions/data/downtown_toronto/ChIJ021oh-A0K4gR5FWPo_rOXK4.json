But before I knew it, I was at the front of the line, where a friendly and responsive staff member took my order.\n\nI went for the Tex-Mex burrito, with a beef \"protein boost\", which apparently is one of the staples of the place. The order was ready in record time.\n\nThe meat was top grade and juicy. All the other ingredients were also of the highest quality. Alas, the entire ensemble simply didn't work for me. Diced beef, mixed with cooked brown rice, wrapped in a tortilla - the combination was bland, inconsistent, and disappointing.\n\nPerhaps it's not fair to punish Freshii for my own taste preferences, seeing as they served exactly what the menu said. Still, calling it \"Tex Mex\" is at least somewhat misleading, especially since, by default, they serve it without meat. I'd call it \"Cali-thali\" - a health-nut's faded facsimile of a hearty Southern favourite.\n\nPrice is well above median, although likely in line with other \"health conscious\" chains. The ounce or so of meat added $4 to an already pricey burrito. Across the street, you can sit down for a decent, leisurely lunch, main and side dish, for about the same price, albeit without the pleasure of lining up with backpack-toting fashion students.",
