I had been looking for a professional, clean studio with talented artists and after doing my research, I found that Black Line had been recognized on multiple occasions with awards. I easily set up a (free) consultation with Lorena via email and didn't have to wait long. Once I met Lorena, we discussed what I wanted and she estimated the amount of time she would need to complete my tattoo which enabled her to give me a cost estimate beforehand. Prior to my tattoo appointment, I was sent a (beautiful) stencil of my tattoo which was excellent. On the day of, I walked right in and Lorena began working right away. She was extremely gentle and quick - my estimated 3 hour tattoo took 1.5 hrs and it turned out better than I could have hoped for. Since then, I have returned to see Lorena and even brought my best friend along - who is also convinced that Black Line is amazing! Highly recommended.",

            "text": "This place is a joke. The owner of this Company is a wacko. The rates are not good either esp when you have apprentices taking on big pieces and their work is garbage.  180/Hr ? for someone who can't even do a line without it looking shaky or disproportionate.\n\nI had a consult once and saw their social media. It's beyond sad. \n\nThey have an artist who thinks she's a big shot but all her work looks overly busy & the tattoos are all googled. isn't this a custom art studio? why are tattoos being done though google if your paying 180/hr? \n\nsome of the work on their social media is beyond gross. for a high end studio they have really crappy artists. The only good artist at this location specializes in black work & dots, I believe she is from Mexico. \n\nThe staff in the front are wonderful. I was there a few months ago and the nice gentleman with a beard & British Girl were very sweet.  They explained everything i needed to know.\n\nover all not Toronto's #1 shop. Your better off going somewhere else.",

She was very helpful in answering all my questions and walking me through the process. I have since gone back, this time to get piercings, and met Kaleb. He made the experience very enjoyable with his fun personality and was very quick to put me at ease during the procedure. Everyone I've met so far has been extremely friendly and professional. I will definitely be coming back for more tattoos and I would recommend Black Line Studio to anybody!",
