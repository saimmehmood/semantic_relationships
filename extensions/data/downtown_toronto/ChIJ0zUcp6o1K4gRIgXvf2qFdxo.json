The price is not cheap but for the quality and service it's totally worth it. This would be a great place to try for newbies to the vegan world and also great for vegan veterans. It's right downtown Toronto so parking sucks, I would suggest walking or taking public transit. I will definately be eating here again and I highly recommend.",

Today I asked for edamame to be added to the Vitamin Sea bowl....I get home and sure enough no edamame which I paid for!!  Sometimes the portions are good....most of the time small and missing ingredients.  Very pricey too.  Management:  please make up your mind on proper portions and train your staff.   27 bucks for a salad and a smoothie....I am super pissed. I'm done with this place.  How much are fruits and veggies anyway??  And don't get me started on the clumpy day old rice. Please.  If you want healthy look for another place I'm sure there's better value for your money and better food for that matter. I'm hungry already.\n\n**Update!  It's been over 2 weeks that I emailed Bolt about my complaint....as they asked, but with NO response as of yet.  Goes to show they don't really care about my feedback, as much as they claim to with their generic auto-response to my initial review.  Even better reason not to shop there anymore.

I have had a few good meals here, but in general the salad dressings are increasingly acidic and the general vibe is crowded. It is a good spot for vegan options, but in my opinion there are other places I would recommend first.",
