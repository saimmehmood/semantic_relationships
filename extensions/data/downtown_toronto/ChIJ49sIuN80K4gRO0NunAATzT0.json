She was fantastic! I was very very pleased with everything.   She used initiative and she had the right foundation for my skin tone.  She was personable, friendly and knowledgable. She's an absolute pro!    I could tell that she has a passion for beauty and a passion for helping me feel my best. Jenn is now my first choice for the next time I need my makeup done.

My experience with Jen was nothing like that, she totally read my personality and what I was going for with very little direction from me. She didn't cut any corners and you can tell she wants you to feel incredible on top of looking incredible - which I definitely did. Schulz will definitely be my go-to from now on! Also, the price was so reasonable especially for such an upscale salon with quality brands and for the results.  ",
