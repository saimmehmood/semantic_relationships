They contacted us promptly same day afternoon, showed up at the site an hour later and we have had assessment of drain problem ready. Fedor is very professional and skilled technician and took his time to explain in details the ways to tackle the problem, few options were discussed. Aquamaster\u2019s quote turned out to be most reasonable \u2013 cost and time most effective. Job was done promptly, kept working area clean \u2013job required to remove flooring in basement, digging out old drain pipe, replacing with new pipe, extracting tree roots which cost a blockage in the first place. After job done we found site all neat & clean, all area was swept & vacuumed.\nI will definitely use Aquamaster again & highly recommend to others.",

            "text": "Called Aquamaster for a job that required to troubleshoot a problem with a kitchen sinc, water was not coming out, even though we changed to a new one. Fedor came one afternoon and assured me what the problem was, and that next day it will be fixed.  I trusted him immediately, since I have used Aquamaster in the past and they always deliver.\n\n Yuri, the plumber came the very next day with a new faucet and all necessary stuff, he was on time, clean & very approachable.  He finished his job & tested a few times to ensure there were no leaks.  He also sealed something else for us at no charge.\n\nFor any plumbing or waterproofing needs, I always call them, their honesty and professionalism is hard to find in this trade.\nFedor and his team are the best !!!! I have recommend them to many of my friends and they all are happy.\n\nThanks.\nCarlos Montoya.",
