I don't generally write reviews, because maybe my experience was an outlier, but seeing everyone in the restaurant with the same look and the lack of caring from the staff, I felt obligated.\n\nPros: Food, great flavors, eggs were all good well. The French Toast with Duck confit was extremely creative, and having the duck combined with the richness of the cream is not a traditional combination, but they make it work well. Coffee, great French pressed coffee with a wide selection. \n\nCons: where to begin...from the start when we asked if we could grab a coffee and sit on the patio before they opened and were told no, should have been a start.  30 minute wait for coffee, had to ask 3x for orange juice (which is mainly ice), 3x for a jug of water for the table because...well after 30 minutes you get thirsty.  Hour and a half wait for food. Mimosa which may as well have been their freshly squeeze juice (to the point not bubbles could be seen). Service, some of the worst I have experienced in Toronto in a long time.\n\nWe were the first table seated at 10 am...didn't get out until noon. \n\nI personally never would go back, we have too many good options in the city.",

            "text": "My husband and I were on a hunt for a local brunch spot and this place is one of our favourites so far. I had the Ace Hill Breakfast from the menu and it was delicious. The pork was crispy on the outside, yet tender on the inside, which I loved. We came back with a group of friends, and they all enjoyed it too. The only downside would be the long waiting time and some people may think that the food is a bit on a the oilier/heavier side. Otherwise, I would recommend checking out this place.",

We showed up for brunch on a Sunday, the place was full but instead of sending us away they made us feel a 5 minute wait was worth it. \n\nPeople leaving raved about the food and left with a smile making our decision to sit down unquestionable. \n\nWe sat down and immediately enjoyed the playlist and the choices on the menu. The main part of our meal was great. We had the club sandwich and the beast. The fried chicken was perfectly done with a great deal of flavour. The side salad ordered was my only issue it was less then half a handful of spring mix and about 2 pickled onions. It was not even really a salad and more of a garnish, and not something worth paying for. That being said the actual food is great and I will be back for more",
