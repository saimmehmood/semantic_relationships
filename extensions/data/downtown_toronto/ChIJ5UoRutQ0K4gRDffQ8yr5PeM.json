Compared to my own insurance company that I have been with for almost 25 years, this quote was AMAZING!  They looked for any discount available and the young woman, Samantha, went above and beyond for us.  I can't thank you enough.  I know insurance is tough for young fellas, but my own company' s quote was outrageous!!!!   Thank you again PC for helping my son get his first insurance!!!!",

Every year since first getting insurance my premium decreased a small amount. (and a much larger amount when I turned 25) \n\nLast year for apparently no reason my premium went up about 5%. (No accidents or claims)  I didn't think much of it and wasn't in a rush to change insurance companies.  Then this year rolls around and it's time to renew once again.  Once again my premium is going up about 5%.\n\nI called Belair to see why this was happening, to which I was given little to no good reason.  After trying to adjust my rate for a little while, it comes back at the same price.  So I do some online shopping as one would do, and I find that PC gives me the best quote online.\n\nAfter receiving my quote I called the number provided in the email they sent me. Within 10 minutes I was set up with new insurance.  No hassles.  The prices I was given was slightly higher than the quote, but still a few hundred dollar less than Belair Direct, with whom I was been a loyal customer for 10+ years.\n\nIf you're looking for new insurance I would suggest giving PC a chance for yourself.  I had no problems at all like the ones other people seem to have had.  The customer service has been great, and the price was lower than anywhere else I got a quote.",
