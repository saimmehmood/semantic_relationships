I found them on QVC and bought it b/c I trust QVC (Surfeasy was an unknown company at the time). I've had good service with Surfeasy. I've had an occasional issue but Surfeasy has Always taken care of it. Tell me of a software that hasn't had an occasional issue? This IS NOT a scam company. I'm shocked at some of the negativity by some who haven't even given them a chance to correct issues. QVC does Not sell scam products!! I wholeheartedly endorse The Surfeasy product. I am Not a paid reviewer. My motivation here is to support a quality product and good people because that is getting harder to find these days. Feel free to contact me about my experience with Surfeasy. They also support and inform us about internet privacy laws. Our governments are giving our privacy away and we need to fight this!! Congress is accepting lobby money from service providers (comcast and others) WHO ARE SELLING YOUR BROWSING HISTORY FOR THEIR PROFIT! That disgusts me and it should you too! Thanx for listening.",

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because there is currently no app offered for smart tv's. I have a Sony Android smart tv and while it has the Google Play Store built in, SurfEasy is not available for download. I've had to install and pay a separate monthly fee for another vpn provider just for my tv. It would be cheaper for me to go with just one provider, but I want to support a Canadian company and the app itself it great. Please consider making the vpn app available for smart tv's and Android boxes!",
