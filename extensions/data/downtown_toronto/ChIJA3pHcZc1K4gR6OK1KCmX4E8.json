I was so numb by the time I reached home. When the numbness went away, my fear kicked in. I have young children and really need the job to make ends meet. I went on my computer and googled lawyers who deal with this sort of stuff. I called many lawyers and they all told me that I don\u2019t have a case legally and to look for another job. Some of them told me they would write a letter on my behalf to my boss, it would cost me $500 but that was as far as they would take it. \nI kept scrolling down the google page and saw Trinh Paralegal Services. I had already lost hope but thought I had nothing else to lose. There was this heavy feeling in my heart that if lawyers say there isn\u2019t a case then how can a paralegal help me? I was willing to make this last phone call to see what this company has to offer. \nI spoke with Samantha. She patiently waited while I purged myself of all my feelings, including my fear of not being able to make ends meet. I must have taken at least an hour of her time before she even said a single word to me. When I was finally done, Samantha asked a few questions, and then said that I do have a case, but I would need to speak with her personally. I said that I have young children and can\u2019t come out to see her. That very same evening, Samantha came out to see me at my place to talk some more. \nShe told me that I don\u2019t have an employment issue. She said I had a human rights issue. It turns out that the week before they fired me I had asked my boss for accommodation as I was sorting out some health issues. I even gave them my doctors note. I never made that connection but luckily Samantha did. I told her that I don\u2019t have money to pay her. She said no problem, either she will seek her payment from the other side or she would do it for me for free because she says I have a real case. I cried some more with her and when I could cry no more, I thanked her and she left after I signed some papers to say she is my paralegal. \nThe next day my boss called me and said that I restart my job next week but from when I was fired until I restart my job, I would be paid. I called Samantha to tell her the good news and asked if I could pay now but she said no, because my bosses paid her fees. I don\u2019t know how Samantha did it but she really saved my life that day.",
