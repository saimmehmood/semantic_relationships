Then I get a cheque for 106, they said the can only give whats paid so far even though they've seen in my contract I still have to pay the rest over the next year and a half or so. What's the point in having insurance if I'm not going to be covered? Never go with AIG/World Nomads in Canada for travel insurance, and by the looks of the reviews, any other insurance through them either.",

Really?\nBuyer beware with these misleading crooks and tricksters!  Shop for clear and honest insurance elsewhere.",
