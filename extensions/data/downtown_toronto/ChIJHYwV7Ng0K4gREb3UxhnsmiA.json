Let's just say I waited an hour and nobody showed up. It seemed like this clinic was permanently closed. I even asked few pedestrians and they had no clue. There was a gentleman waiting for someone as well and he felt so bad for me that he decided to give them a call. I told him it's not necessary because nobody's in the office to pick up but he continued. He heard the answering machine and said \"they say they open at 9am.\" He couldn't believe how unprofessional they were either and told me to dump this place and find another clinic.. so I went another clinic to get a treatment..\n\nMaybe it is permanently closed and all the websites are not up-to-date? There was no business hours sign hanging on the door so it gave me the impression that they don't care about their business sincerely and seriously. If they are still operating and say they open at 9 am on their website but don't show up even at 10am, I wouldn't be surprised if they would be permanently closed soon.",
