I found Perfect Pitch through a Google search when I was looking for a piano teacher in downtown Toronto, and the reviews convinced me to sign up for a lesson. I am so glad I did. I've been taking lessons with Susan for about six months now. I started with only a very basic ability to read music and never had played piano before. Within the first lesson, Susan had me learning pieces that were fun to play and perfectly aligned with my skill level at the time. I am amazed at how much I have improved in such a short time since then and it is entirely thanks to her lessons each week and the clear instruction she provides to ensure you're getting the most out of your practice at home. I would recommend her to anyone who is serious about learning the piano.",
