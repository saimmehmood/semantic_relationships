DO NOT skip any of the 3 sessions, however after the first one I knew it had stuck. Leading up to the 3rd one (about a month later) I actually considered calling the clinic to see if I could donate my 3rd session to someone who may be having trouble. It's that easy and effective. I'm around people all the time who are smoking and it's just like...you see it, you smell it, and you can't even bring yourself to even thinking about doing it again. \n\nMoney. Very. Well. Spent.",

While I have not been smoking for anywhere near as long as she has I was well and truly hooked on cigarettes. To be honest, I thought that it would be just another gimmick that didn't work, I found myself pleasantly surprised when I walked out of the amazing office of NuLife in Woodbridge and instead of encountering Cravings like I normally would I experienced nothing. I have tried to quit cold turkey several times, but each time I failed. I truly believe that cigarettes had a hold of me for life had it not been for the laser acupuncture from NuLife Laser Clinic. The thing that surprised me the most was that I was able to be covered by my extended health insurance plan. Now I feel that I have my health and control back, and cigarettes no longer dominate my life. I would have easily spent more on cigarettes in a month than what I spent on my laser treatment, so I really feel that it not only saved my health but also saved me lots of money. Thanks NuLife and I\u2019ll be sending all of my smoker friends your way.",
