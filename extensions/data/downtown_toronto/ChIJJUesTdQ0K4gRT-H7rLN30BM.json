            "text": "I came here for dinner for my friend's birthday. It was a short walk from The Rec Room and the tables were all ready when we inquired at the host stand. We had the back section near the open kitchen; split between the booths and high tops. \n\nThe reviews recommended the carbonara and the photos that I saw confirmed my decision. The waitress was pretty attentive for the group of our size. There were around 30 guests in the group. The dish was as delicious as I thought it would be. It was confirmed that the other dishes I saw around me were equally as good. \n\nThe one thing that wasn't as pleasant was the cake cutting fee. I understand we didn't order dessert from the restaurant and the restaurant may impose a fee for storing, cutting and distributing cake from another establishment. What I didn't appreciate was that each bill was charged $2 for cake cutting. To me that seemed a bit excessive as I'm sure there were more than 15 bills that night.",

The outdoor patio seating was really nice for a spring day in Toronto and it's close to the ACC, Ripley's Aquarium and other attractions near the Rogers Centre. The atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful and service was great. I ordered the french toast with bananas, brandy syrup and toasted walnuts and it was amazing. My friend got the brioche burger with the fried egg and homefries and was thoroughly impressed. The menu has a lot of options for vegetarians and a lot of options were healthy. They also have an impressive selection of wines. Would definitely return for brunch and late night dining for a game.",
