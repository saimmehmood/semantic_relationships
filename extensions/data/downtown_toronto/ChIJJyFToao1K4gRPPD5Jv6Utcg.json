It took a few minutes for our beers to arrive. Okay. Then, people who got seated after us and ordered after us got their food first. By the time our food arrived, the people who got seated after us had already finished their food and left while we were still waiting for our food. It took 40-50 minutes!!!!!!!!! The one staff ended up just sitting outside with a beer. So. Much. LOL! Eventually, our food came. Mine wasn't spicy at all and I asked for spicy. The portions are small and it's expensive for what you're getting. The price is different from their website. I wouldn't go back to eat, but I would just get their coffee to go.",

There was no attempt to orient us to the menu or to inquire whether we have had this cuisine before. \n\nWhen our platters arrived at the table, they were simply left there again with no attempt to explain what was what especially considering we made it very clear to them that a couple of members of our group were strictly vegetarian while the rest were not. \n\nWe were also greeted with confused looks when we asked for something as simple as cutlery or a napkin. \n\nThe food was good, but again the experience was frustrating. Would not go back.",
