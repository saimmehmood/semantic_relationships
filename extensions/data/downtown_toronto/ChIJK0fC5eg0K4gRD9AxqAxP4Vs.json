It felt weird to have someone in the room but we definitely needed their help, also I liked how they emphasized teamwork which was interesting. We were close to finishing but had a few roadblocks along the way, it was still really fun though. \n\nNow the things I felt they could improve on is definitely production value - the room felt bare bones with some very used ikea furniture. I've been to another escape room for around the same price with really high production, and I have to say that it does really make a difference in how immersive the whole experience is. I know it might not feasible to do since it takes time/money for high production, but I think they can at least improve on refining the current rooms a bit.",

Only of a few of the puzzles had to do with the theme at all. The overall concept of the game was interesting, but you have to get pretty far into it before that becomes apparent. Plus, with the degree of difficulty I felt like we were constantly asking for help with the puzzles so there was little sense of accomplishment when we succeeded. When we won the game even then it was unclear we did so... until we all just wandered out of the room and were congratulated. There was just no real sense of urgency, no immersion. I guess most of the price goes to the helpful and kind staff there that would be impossible to succeed without.",
