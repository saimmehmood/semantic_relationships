At 8pm, I followed up and was told they were really busy and the driver had just left.  We waited another 30 minutes and followed up again.  Again I was told it had just left and would be there any minute.  By 9PM, I called and was given the run around about whether or not they had even prepared my food.  I didn't even get an apology for the total mess up.\nThe second time was about a year later.  How could they mess it up again?  Spectacularly, actually.  It was de ja-vu all over again.  Followed up after an hour and again as told it was on it's way.  We had to leave in an hour, and waited another 30 min before calling again.  When we got the same BS, we cancelled the order.  As before, we didn't even get an apology.  We had our jackets on to leave when the driver showed up and told us we owed them money for the 2 hour late mediocre food.",

The first time it contained 3 corse long black hairs which made me gag but I still gave it another chance because things happen in the kitchen.  Tonight, however topped it off. I found two small black bugs floating around my soup. Never again. Just disgusting. Glad I did not get  food poisoning, the place could care less for any type of sanitary standards.",
