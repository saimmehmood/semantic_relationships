Out of nowhere a male that worked at the club barged into our stall DEMANDING HER TO LEAVE that second. I being the sober one, explained to him that she needed a minute to at least finish throwing up and to at least wait for her good friends to come meet us (Since I had just met her hours ago). Out of no where 2 huge security guards start VIOLENTLY PULLING ME OUT the stall!!!!! Mind you I am a woman that is 5'2 and 110lbs!!! THEY WERE ON A SERIOUS POWER TRIP!!! Before I knew it I was being violently pulled up the stairs in my heels, feeling like I was going to fall over and TWIST MY ANKLE from all the aggression and physical pain I was in. I ended up on the street WITHOUT A JACKET (Since they would not let me get it) in -15 weather in a club outfit!!!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISRESPECTED IN MY LIFE!!!! I urge any woman considering going to this club to think twice!!!! God forbid if anything were to happen to you, like what happened to my friend, the staff will not look out for you!!!! They will treat you like dirt like they did to us. THEY DO NOT CARE AND THERE US NO HUMANITY!!! I am still in complete disbelief!!! It really saddens my heart knowing this in the world we live in where a woman's drink can be spiked and she will be kicked out on the street alone without a jacket and have her friend trying to protect her violently pulled out the club. Wildflower and their staff are completely disgusting!!! So many things could have happened to her if that idiot had put her on the street in the first place like he wanted to.",

It's funny because this was my first experience back in the Toronto nightclub scene after I took a break due to rude staff and terrible sketchy crowds at a lot of different places . \nWord of advice to everyone , limit the amount you drink before arriving at the door , it makes communication with staff a lot easier , most of you don't even realize how annoying it is dealing with a group of drunk entitled people trying to get in a club \n\nCrowd was excellent and I liked the layout of the place ,  only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the DJ didn't kill it like he could've ( a little too much top 40) as the night progresses he did drop some better tracks for sure .",

My friend and I were quietly talking in the corner minding our own business when the bouncer came up to me and kicked me out for absolutely no reason. My friend questioned the bouncer for throwing me out because I wasn't causing any problems and the bouncer put my friend in a full nelson and carried him up the stairs. We had paid for overpriced cover and was just politely asking the bouncer why I was getting kicked out and we were completely disrespected.
