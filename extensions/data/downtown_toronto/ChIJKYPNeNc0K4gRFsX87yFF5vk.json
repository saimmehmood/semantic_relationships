I pointed it out to her as I didn\u2019t want the bubble in my manicure. She was a little offended and painted another coat on my nail. I picked an extremely light pink/white colour so the third coat made my thumb nail look a lot more solid. Due to this I asked if she was ok with doing a third coat on all nails to match the colour. She got extremely upset at this point. She was extremely rushed with the rest of the manicure (colour and top coat) and she was being rude. I apologized for the inconvenience and she sarcastically responded calling me ma\u2019am I have to do whatever you want. She also asked me if I had ever gotten shellac before. I am a working professional that keeps extremely groomed and get shellac manicures at least 9 times a year at polished nail bar in the path (they are amazing and always do three coats!!!!) Keep in mind she is at least 20 years older than me. I am 24. She then proceeded to tell me to stop talking and then bitched about me to the receptionist while I was in earshot! I went up to pay and the transaction was extremely awkward. I tipped her a full 15% as I was so uncomfortable but definitely should not have. I will never go here again. Extremely disappointed with the service and it sucks because they are a 5 minute walk from home. I rather pay twice the price and have a decent interaction.",

However, everyone I\u2019ve ever gone to has always gotten frustrated or impatient with me as my hair appointments do take forever.  I have typically always ended up leaving with a poor haircut. That has never been the case with the team at Room 1Six. Not only is everyone talented, they also care that I enjoy my time there and the end result. They never seem to be annoyed with me when I book an appointment and always welcome me with warmth. I love coming here and have finally found my salon! Plus, Amy always makes my nails look amazing!",

Mix will definitely hook you up. Took the time to evaluate my hair and the style I was hoping to achieve before giving me exactly what I was looking for. The salon is immaculate/aesthetically pleasing and every stylist in the room is a complete gem. From the moment you walk in you will feel right at home.",
