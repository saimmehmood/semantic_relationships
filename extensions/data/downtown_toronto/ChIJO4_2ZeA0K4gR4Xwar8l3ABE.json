When my severe back pain left me no choice but to seek out another doctor last weekend, I found Dr. Pamela Fardy, and I am so glad that I did because she has restored my faith in the Chiropractic treatment. My first appointment with her was at 7:30 in the am, she offered to plan our appointment around my 9-5 job, and spent the time to educate me what chiropractic does and how it will ease my pain. She was very welcoming, informative, patient and professional. After the first treatment she also taught me a few stretches to do at home, and I set up another appointment for the very next morning at 7:15am. Obviously the healing takes more time than a few visits with any doctor, but I have faith that Dr. Fardy will be the one leading me to the road of recovery! \nRecommend 100%!",

I believe that what really sets Pam apart is her genuine approach and true concern towards all of her patients and their recovery.\n\nPam is flexible and accommodating when it comes to scheduling appointments and thorough with follow up while seeking treatment. Having successfully been treated myself for two injuries (torn tendon and dislocated shoulder) I can confidently state that my quick turnaround and recovery was all a reflection of Pam\u2019s work.I have since referred several friends all with varying injuries and concerns and they too have had the most pleasant of experiences.",
