When I showed this to Mr. Lee, he told me it was impossible that they caused this and that it was from wear and tear. I had only worn the shirt twice prior, and obviously did NOT drop it off in this condition. \n\nIn the end, it was a struggle to be reimbursed for the cost of the \"dry cleaning\" and he refused to admit that they caused the damage to my clothing.
