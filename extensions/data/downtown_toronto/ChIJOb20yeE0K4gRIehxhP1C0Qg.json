We have been going to them for the last 5 years, but NOT THIS LOCATION, THIS WAS OUR FIRST TIME! Do not get your taxes filed here, we got a Chinese Woman and she clearly did not know what she was doing but we still gave her a chance. After our taxes were done, we got sent home with no paper work or any copies of our tax return! We had to ask her when we were getting our tax return and how much the return was, when it should have been her job to tell us. THE WORST PART WAS.... two hours later she calls us at 8pm and tells us that she forgot to get us to sign papers for our Tax Returns! All she could do is apologize, but when you are dealing with a customer's tax return there is no room for mistakes and a sorry does not cut it. Provide your staff with the proper training and if they are clearly illiterate they should not be doing anyone's tax return. 5 years doing our taxes with H&R BLOCK and THIS BY FAR WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Go else where! We learned our lesson $300 later. STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION, you are as good as getting a Monkey to file your taxes instead.",
