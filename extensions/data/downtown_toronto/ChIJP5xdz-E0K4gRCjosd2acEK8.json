Not only were the food portions tiny, overpriced and subpar (the calamari appetizer had two small pieces of calamari at 18$) but the customer service was extremely unprofessional. The bar tender working that night repeatedly came to our table to hit on me and my sister. However, we were surprised to find that the worst service came from the manager himself. He was drinking wine on the job, also came to our table multiple times to chat and would make sexual and degrading remarks, then when we reacted negatively he would brush it off and say things like \u201cI know I\u2019m an ass\u201d. He even \u201cjokingly\u201d told us that his goal in the restaurant is to bring in customers and get as much money out of them as possible. Definitely not coming back and would not recommend if you\u2019re looking for a nice evening downtown.",
