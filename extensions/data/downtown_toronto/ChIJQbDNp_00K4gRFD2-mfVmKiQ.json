            "text": "I must have passed this spot so many times and I never realized that it was a coffee spot.  From the window, all you see is the old records and some rock paraphernalia.  Once you walk in, you see the espresso machine and the really nice cafe sitting area in the back.\n\nI find the atmosphere quite different in a good way.  Rather than hipster cool or lap top hording... this place has a bit of an edge with a lot of the exposed walls painted dark and rock posters hanging about.  If a coffee shop and a man cave merged into one place, Antikka would be it.  I do have to admit though... if a man cave could have the array of baklava as this place did, I may claim the cave as mine.\n\nThe front of the store is mostly clean and well stocked boxes holding all the records.  They have some brand new ones and some gently/previously loved.  The prices seemed reasonable... $14 for some?  I'm not sure what the going rate is these days.  Either way, a lot of the records here looked like in great condition and all in sleeves.  Perhaps thats the norm but it seemed like they really cared about what they are selling.  \n\nThe back of the store is mostly the cafe with a real espresso machine and an entire display of baklava.  I should have bought some!  There are a few cute small tables along the wall with really nice cross sections of a tree trunk as a table.  I like when the beauty of nature shows up unexpectedly.\n\nService here is quick and friendly... Even though he was answering a few questions on other thing, he wasn't stopping making cups of cappuccino or flat whites.  I did notice they use Hale coffee beans ... this isn't a knock on Antikka but I've decided that Hale Coffee beans are the most sour and acidic of the Toronto roasters.  To me, it's not a good flavour... which is unfortunate cause I'd love to support any Toronto roaster.\n\nFlat White - Even knowing it was Hale coffee beans used, I would say the skill of heating the milk, balance of espresso to milk, and even the pour... it's good.  It's possibly the best Hale Coffee drink I've had... even it was better than the one I had at Hale itself.  It still wasn't a great cup since the acidity was there but it wasn't as bad as other spots.  3.5/5\n\nOverall, great interesting spot for you to check out if you love records and coffee.  I bet you can score a great conversation with the staff as they seem to really enjoy their craft and the music.  I may not come back for the coffee but I'd be willing to try the baklava!",
