She was very knowledgeable about the condo and housing market, and was able to provide good advice about what price to list our condos and what price to offer on our house. She arranged the photography and staging of our two condos, and the photographs were beautiful! She helped us out right until the day our house closed, and even offered to stop by our new house to confirm that it was clean and all the appliances worked on the day before closing! I would highly recommend her services to anyone looking to buy or sell property!",
