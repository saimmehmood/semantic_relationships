And, I mean a proper altar...with a photo of this horrible man, a table with candles and everything.   How can you glorify a man who killed thousands and made lots of people leave their country?  I get that is the owner's attempt at being \"cool\", but it's a very lame attempt and honestly, if you identify yourself with these values, i.e. killing people and terrorizing an entire country, you do not deserve anyone's business.  Please do not go to this place.   Would you go to a bar called Hitler's?  Didn't think so.",
