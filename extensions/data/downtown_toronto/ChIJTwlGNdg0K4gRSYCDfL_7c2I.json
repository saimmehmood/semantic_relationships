So if want to live in downtown and don't want to buy a parking because you rent cars only on weekends (which a lot of people do), and you chose this building, you will pay a heavy parking fees at P1 /P2 levels AND wont be able to take the elevators to go to your floor from parking. Also, if you have guests visiting, since there is no visitor parking in this building, you will have to ask your guests to park in paid parking at P1 / P2 and then go outside the building to come to ground floor and take the elevators from there. Makes it worse when you are back from vacation or shopping and have lot of luggage to carry to your floor. It seems not that big of an issue, but is a nightmare if you have kids, a lot of luggage and when it's super cold outside. What's most frustrating is that you are a resident, you see elevator entrance right in front of you with access controlled through fob but you can't call the elevators to this parking level.",

Sometimes management works really hard to maintain quality and the place is quality,  but a bad employee completely ruins that for both management and residents. \n\nS IGNASIOUS, an extremely rude Concierge, stopped my moving just for fun and to show off his powers. He was too lazy to go look for the elevator booking form and kept saying he does not have it. He did not care that we were fasting and exhausted and paid a lot for the move. He was almost enjoying our misery. He finally found the form after multiple requests by going to a different office but was extremely offensive and aggresive with me and my uncle who is a senior. Disgraceful. In all my years, living in downtown condos I have never come across a concere or a man this cold and rude. In my opinion he was truly enjoying making things difficult for us.\n\nOn a positive note, I also had the pleasure of talking to a different Concere, Raj and he was a real gentleman and very helpful.",
