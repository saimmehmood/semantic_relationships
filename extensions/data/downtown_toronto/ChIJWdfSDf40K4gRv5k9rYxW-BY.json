My friends and I got there, waited 15 minutes in line and decided to dip when the people infront of us told us it would be an hour wait. As we were exiting the line, one of the bouncer's told us to head on down to the front once he saw there was four of us. When we got inside it became obvious that the lineup outside was meant to make it look busy. There was plenty of room and the setup was really nice. If your looking to grab some drinks and chill, there is space for you. If you're hoping to get some drinks and play some games, there is space for you. Security is very nice, bartenders are attentive, and the overall crowd is mature, respectful, and fun. The waiting outside sucks, but once you get inside it's a fun time! As the night progressed, it started to fill up so my advice is try to get there before midnight.",

Took our  Business To three other clubs on queen. Best  decision we made. \n\nSo funny how the Asian bouncer even told the black bouncer that he contradicted himself by letting us in to us the bathroom. We wouldn\u2019t made it up those stairs if we were that \u201cintoxicated\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d as they put it.\n\nEven met with a girl a block away that heard how confused and distort we were about how the bouncer contradicted himself by letting us in the club to use the bathroom and leave. She said she wanted the place to shut down. We agree\n\nNEVER GOING AGAIN, trust me fam.",
