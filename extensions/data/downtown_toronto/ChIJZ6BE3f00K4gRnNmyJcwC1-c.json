She was a pleasure to spend time with and my hair now feels so healthy again - I can\u2019t stop touching it. I\u2019ve already gone ahead and booked my appointments for the rest of the year.

I used to work in Liberty Village so I would pass by the Ossington location every day. Their website is very helpful, as it lists all of their colourists and stylists by rank and expertise. I used the online booking form and chose Stephanie, who is an intermediate stylist. She is literally the sweetest! She asked me so many questions and was very helpful with determining the right cut for my hair based on the style I was looking for. She took her time, (like, actually took her time!), and I think that makes all the difference. She's super chill, not bossy and really dedicates herself to meet her clients needs. It's no wonder why she's been there for 6+ years! She's a rock star! I'll be back to see her for sure :)",

She's coloured my hair vibrant shades of red, given me sweet layers, trimmed and softened without taking off too much when I'm only looking for a refresh, and is especially great at cutting my bangs the way I like them. It all comes down to communication, and she's super friendly, which makes her really easy to talk to. She listens to what I have to say which is key in getting what I want. I highly recommend Martha.",
