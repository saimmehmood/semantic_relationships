This has been my observation during every visit since I got registered as a client. \n\nMy psychiatrist and the group therapy personnel are compassionate, always concerned and resourceful.

He told me that the closest thing I have with anxiety is generalized anxiety  which I could have told him myself he told me that I don't have enough panic attacks to have Generalized anxiety that I need to have one everyday . This is all from the first day, today I go back for a follow up and I had to explain everything to him again of how I was feeling. Not only that but my appointment was at 3pm today so I get there early and the doctor took me in at 3:20pm and had the nerve to ask me if I had just got there and was smiling the whole time I was beyond mad and I told him how I felt. As we were talking I told him from the last time I saw him last week I had 3 panic attacks and he said yea from March and I said no he tried to not listen to how I was feeling because I had to keep repeating my self over and over as he was asking me the same questions. After that he had suggested that he change my whole medication system and give me 2 different types of medications I feel like he had no clue at what he was doing he didn't even know what AA was. I am not very happy with the service I got, the doctors should know what they are doing.",
