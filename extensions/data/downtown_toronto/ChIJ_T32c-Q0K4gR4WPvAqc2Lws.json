The experience began in October (it's now June of the following year.)\n\n*Here's a timeline:*\n\nOctober 2016: Company signs up with Humi for HR software and group benefits.\n\nNovember-March: We continually request updates and end up with empty promises of \"Soon - sorry to keep you waiting\" while they work through getting us set up.\n\nMarch - Have a video conference call with our team and a Humi rep. The Humi rep doesn't know any of the answers to our questions, such as how much the plan will cost, what drugs/services are included/excluded and only some information on what the co-pay is. She promises to follow up with the answers and it never happens. Says that we will have all of our plan packets, cards, and details before May.\n\nMay - I personally have a call and email chain running with said rep, then another recommended by our HR, who also doesn't know any of the answers that I need, though does get them to me within a few days. Great! She says that we will get our drug cards and ID numbers shortly. This does not happen.\n\nMay 30 - The founder of the company says that our HR company requested that they send the cards directly to each of us, and lets me know that they are already in the mail. \n\n(Mail to the other end of the country, in my personal experience, takes a week or slightly more. Humi is in Toronto, and half of our team is in the GTA. What is this, mail for ants?)\n\nJune 12 - I reach out to him for an update. Ignored.\n\nJune 26: I still have not gotten any update from Humi. \n\nI reached out to Empire Life, the company that they selected for our group benefits. They were able to get me my online logins, send me my cards, give me the ID numbers I needed, and tell me where to visit online to register and get reimbursed. All within a matter of five minutes. \n\n5/5 for Empire Life, 0/5 for Humi. \n\nI'm a pretty patient person, but this experience has been nothing but a disappointment and hassle. The lack of communication makes it even more frustrating, alongside the empty promises. We eventually plan to bring my spouse onto my benefits and I fear how long that process will take.",
