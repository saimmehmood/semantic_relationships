I went in for a caramel balayage and she was so confident and comfortable with her work and since I hadn't coloured my hair in a little while, this put me at ease. She explained what she was doing, as she was doing it which was amazing and didn't leave me guessing. She was also great conversation during. The salon itself was also quite modern with amazing artwork (from local artists I was told), and the music just gave the place a \"feel good\" vibe. Definitely recommend this salon + Stacey! :)",

            "text": "I had an okay experience that turned into a literal nightmare! Long story short, my hair had pretty intense banding after a single wash after being coloured by Stacey in late February. I emailed the salon letting them know that I was unhappy with how my hair turned out. Stacey offered to fix my hair and the banding for free. I booked a time with her and sent her updated pics since it had been about a month since I had come in so she could see my current colour.\n\nShe replied saying thanks and that she would see me Monday (when we had scheduled the appointment). I didn't reply to that message in two days (I didn't feel it was a message necessary to reply to and had replied to all previous texts). So today Stacey sent me a message saying she was done with me. I've attached the screenshots where she said that my lack of response over her attempts to \"bend over backwards\" to fix what was essentially her mistake upset her and that I could go somewhere else to get my hair fixed. After sending that message she blocked me on Instagram and my phone number (I can tell because none of my messages went through after that). I called the salon and was told Stacey was busy. She then sent me another text saying that my general attitude was upsetting and I can go to a new stylist (she then blocked my number again). I called again asking to speak to a manager. I was told he had clients until 7pm and he would call me back. It is now 9pm. Based on her original message that states that the manager respects her decision, I'm guessing I'll never near from Dat Salon again. They seem content to let someone else clean up their mistakes and let me walk around with banding in my hair and apparently have to fork out money from my pocket to have someone fix my hair. It's a good thing that I paid $300 for this dye job that I'll probably never see again.\n\nI am honestly appalled. I was pleasant to Stacey in all correspondence but I should not have to be grateful that a stylist is fixing their own mistake. I understand that mistakes happen. Not all hair is the same but to expect a client to bend over backwards to make you feel better about your mistake is ridiculous. I'm the one walking around with hair that I literally can't leave down, I'm allowed to be a little upset. And the fact that a stylist and salon are okay with completely cutting a client off and blocking all forms of communication for little to no reason after they gave her a bad dye job is completely unacceptable and unprofessional. I've attached pictures of what my hair looks like now after ~5-7 washes. You be the judge of whether or not this is an acceptable hair colour to leave your client with. If they don't want to fix the colour, the least they could do is refund me since I didn't get what I paid for.",
