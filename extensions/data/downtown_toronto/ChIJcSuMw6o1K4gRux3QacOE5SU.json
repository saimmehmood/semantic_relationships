Umberto is a stand-up guy that is friendly, trustworthy, honest, and delivers on quality and service. He offered me a better rate than the other places that I got quotes from without compromising the quality or service offered at all. Everything went smoothly, and I am more than pleased with the final result.  I was kept in the loop on the progress of my car, and as soon as it was done, Umberto gave me a call to let me know I could pick up. I was originally supposed to pick up my car on a Wednesday, but Umberto gave me a call on Tuesday evening telling me that I could come get my car early (the night before), especially since it was supposed to snow a bunch the next day and he didn't want me to have a bad drive home. Another, great thing about Bianchi's is that it is open during the day and night, so you can drop off your car when it is convenient for you... whether you are working, or just want to avoid rush hour. I definitely recommend Bianchi Collision!",
