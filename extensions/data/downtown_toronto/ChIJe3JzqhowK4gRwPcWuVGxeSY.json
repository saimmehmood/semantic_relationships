I emailed this company and said why do I need to pay a restocking fee when your website had an issue. The csr emailed me back and said I will receive a full refund once they receive the textbook. I returned this textbook the day it came to my house. The order was in February 14th, today is April first and I still have no refund! I am waiting for more than one month for a textbook to return to their facility and receive my refund, horrible customer service! \nIt takes one second to take my money but it take months and months to receive a refund. I am so pissed off by this company. I have been emailing this company but I am not receiving any emails back. There is no communication whatsoever. You need to wait weeks for an email reply. It is ridiculous to wait over a month to receive a refund. On top of all this I get a email this morning that saying that I need to return this textbook or else I am going to get charged!",

They just stop responding to you at one point, if at all. Have opened multiple tickets for the same issue over a period of months at this point, with no resolution in sight. Also, their ambassador program is an absolute lie. You'll get a code to give to your friends after a transaction, which I did accumulating in excess of 15 referrals which, at a supposed 3 dollars each, is a pretty penny. However, no way to use this money and no help from customer service. Beware.",

Ordered a textbook, was told one date, it never arrived, reached out and then was told a 2nd date, never arrived...Email attempts to reach them waiting 3 days for responses. Tried the 2 different customer numbers - out of service or no answer. Much angst for me over lost money. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Then they responded with some tracking number that I am now dealing with Canada Post with 3 weeks later. They say they are 'e commerce only' so have removed any phone numbers but when you google them - the same phone number shows. They offered to refund part of the book cost IF I remove the BBB complaint. Lovely. Save yourself the terrible service and all your time chasing this and fretting about your order.
