These individuals are clearly passionate about what they do and that love for their craft can be seen through their work.\n\nMy husband and I moved into a new house and wanted to create a reclaimed wood wall in our bedroom. While we had a sense of what we wanted, we weren't quite sure what wood to use and needed some additional expert advice. I did my research of other competitors in the area and I can say I am beyond happy that we chose Deadstok Reclaimed for our project. From the very beginning, Niko was eager to answer any questions that we had, invited us to his shop to check out their wood samples and addressed all any concerns we had during the home consultation visit.\n\nWe were beyond pleased to see the finished result\u2014the reclaimed wood wall makes me smile every time I walk by. Niko and his team were professional from start to finish, priced the project fairly and we look forward to coming to them for future pieces to add to our home.\n\nIrene and Franco",
