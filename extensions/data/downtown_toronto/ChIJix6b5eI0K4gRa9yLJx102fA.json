Mario has no trouble diagnosing those older-vehicle quirks that may leave your typical shop baffled. Best of all, he is very fair with his service. Just got my 1982 246 wagon back, after it suffered a series of fuel and ignition related no-starts. I think it is now running the best it has in years.",
