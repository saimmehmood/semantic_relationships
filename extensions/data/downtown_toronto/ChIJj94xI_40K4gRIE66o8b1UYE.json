            "text": "I dealt directly with Mario when the brakes failed on my car. Luckily, I wasn't driving at the time, and I got the car towed to the shop (using Mario's recommendation - JP Towing).\n\nMy car is very old at this point (18 years), and right off the bat I knew I wasn't going to spend a ton of money to fix it. However, a car's brakes are something you don't want to half-ass, so it had to be done right. I called various garages in the area to get an idea of their prices, but I didn't get a good gut feeling about any of them. It felt like I was being lured in for a grand sales pitch. \n\nI called Mario's last, and spoke to Mario himself. He was direct and to the point, and recommended a towing company to get the car to him. He said he wouldn't charge me anything to assess the problem, and once he did, I could decide whether to commit to the repair. I had a good feeling about his no-nonsense attitude, so I took a chance and decided on his garage.\n\nThe garage itself was clean and organized (as far as garages go), communication was informative and easy, and the work was done very quickly. Not once did I feel that I was being sold to; Mario is not a salesman - he's a problem solver.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Mario's Garage. They seem like decent, honest guys, and are the closest to the illusive \"honest mechanic\" I've found in this city. I'll be going back for any future work.",
