As I went to pay for my sheets, they charged me for using the computer - $1/5min. There was no indication or notice about having to pay for the computer but what got me really upset was the fact that she charged me an extra $1 for using my DEBIT visa card. Her explanation was that they charge $1 for any credit card transactions. I told her this is a Debit Visa Card NOT a credit card. She disagreed and told me it's a credit card LOL I paid and will never go back.",
