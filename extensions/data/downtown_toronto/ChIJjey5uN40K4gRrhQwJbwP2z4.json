After that he INFORMED me about what I needed to do, and guided me through the process.\n\nContinuing with Ari dental was the best oral decision I've made, I no longer fear the dentist, I actually look forward to going.\n\nThe bottom line: If you anything but love your dentist, Ari dental is the way to go, and even if you do, it's worth it to try them out.\n\nThey has a customer in me as long as they are in business.

I have a huge fear of needles, not much tolerance for pain. Dr. Mohajeri was wonderful. He was very detailed during my intro visit and very considerate during the treatments. He and his team provided me with a proposed treatment plan and quotes immediately and let me know how things would work with insurance. I had all the work done in 2 weeks and look forward to my next visit! Everyone at the clinic is very friendly and professional. And the place is very clean, modern and relaxing. I can't say enough great things about Ari Dental.\n\nPS: I previously visited Portrait Dental in Liberty Village and I had Dr. Mohajeri review their treatment plan. He mentioned that there was a lot of unneeded work quoted and my revised treatment plan has saved me a considerable amount of money.",
