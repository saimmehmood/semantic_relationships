He was helpful, informed and usually right on the money when it came to assessing what a home would go for (all of the places we looked at went through bidding wars) - but he didn't pressure us to bid higher or go outside of  our comfort zone budget-wise. Ultimately he found a home that worked perfectly for us, and made sure we won the bidding war.\nOn the selling end, again he was informed and professional - he helped us prepare our condo for listing, gave great advice about staging, and encouraged us to list at the right price to garner substantial interest. The photographer he works with also did a fabulous job with the photos. Thanks to Scott our condo was sold in less than 48 hours, after a bidding war, and over-asking! We couldn't be happier with the outcome, and would recommend Scott to anyone!",
