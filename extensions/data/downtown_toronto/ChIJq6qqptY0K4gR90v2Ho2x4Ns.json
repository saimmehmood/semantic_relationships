Excellent, attentive server even though it was super busy. She mentioned she was usually on the bar but I was so happy she was serving tonight. Wings were delicious. Drinks a great deal. Two of us in the group were servers in the past so we appreciate great service.  Our entire table let her know how great she was at the end of our meal. We are all planning to be back again soon (may even make it a weekly outing!!) 2++++ thumbs up!!!",
