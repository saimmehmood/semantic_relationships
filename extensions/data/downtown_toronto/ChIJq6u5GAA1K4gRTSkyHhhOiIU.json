He has no social skills whatsoever and I am even wondering how he was hired! Terrible terrible! I have an idea though; you should get the young lady that usually works there to teach him proper etiquette as he definately lacks proper people skills! There is no way that I am the only complaint that you have had about this man! Wish you had a minus rating as I would definately put the lowest possible rating! Stay away from this store if he is working! Raj is his name!",
