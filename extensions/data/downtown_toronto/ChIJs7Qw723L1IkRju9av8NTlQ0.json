I emailed the store first to get some idea if parts were available, cost, and time frame for the repair. Received a prompt reply from Devin, tech specialist at the store, who gave me an honest opinion in that parts for this laptop are no-longer available, but possible a part that matched the problem might be found.  An estimate of service, parts, costs, and time frame of 2,3, business days for completion, was given. Based on existing problem. At the store, Devin covered all alternate options before deciding the best route if I did not want the expense of servicing an old laptop. Finally, after a demo on an upgrade, and much questioning on my part, I decided to go with the repair, based on all considerations. The repair service, parts costs, were exactly as quoted.  Time frame, overnight! As i had to contact family in UK, the turnaround time was greatly appreciated. Thank you, Devin.  And front desk staff for your time, information on trade-ins and new computers.",

I get the feeling there is a lot of frustration going around regarding this particular issue.\n\nWanted to do the iPhone battery replacement. Called CC first. Was told to book appointment online via Apple site. Did that and waited a week for it. When I got there the service desk was busy so waited another 20 min. Then was finally told that the batteries are out of stock for 2 or 3 weeks... left with nothing but disappointment and frustration.",

Just over emailing several different places, Jonathan at Carbon Computers was super helpful and kind which was the main reason why I decided to go with Carbon Computers. I dropped the computer off Saturday morning and within 3 hours they called me to come pick it up as it was already done! I am very impressed and will definitely be back for anything computer related.",
