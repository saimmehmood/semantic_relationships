Scott really took the time with us to get us a place that we loved and we couldn't be happier.  Thanks again!",

Scott is the real deal, he is all over and on top of everything going on in downtown Toronto. He's lived exclusively downtown since I can remember (80's) and I would challenge you to find another agent who knows the core better than him. You can drive around and point at buildings/streets residential/commercial and in his head he has the history of what was there who has developed it over the years or knows when something is going to be developed soon.  Upcoming projects etc\nHe also has an amazing team around him and over the years has given me key contacts at lending institutions, lawyers, accountants.  He's also very frank if he can't recommend something or someone. \nLong story short Scott eats sleeps breathes real estate and for a long time now. He is very serious about his business, has no shortage of jokes at the same time has a disarming personality who can quickly understand how to give you the information you need to help you through a stressful situation. Understandably real estate agents are supposed to be paid for this but with Scott I think he may be leaving some on the table...",
