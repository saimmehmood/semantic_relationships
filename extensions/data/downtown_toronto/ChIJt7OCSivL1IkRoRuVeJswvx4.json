There were lots of options for pasta with meat on the menu, so I asked the waiter to make one without the meat and he made it seem like an impossible ask. He told me the only thing I could order was the vegetarian tacos or whatever the other option was. After being a little persistent, he finally gave in and made the pasta an option. That's the only reason they're getting less than 5 stars. Great place but not if you're vegetarian.",

They set us up and offered to have our meal at the bar (which we did).  The girls working behind the bar were friendly and personable making us laugh and have a genuinely good time.

Ambience is nice and the restaurant is a comfortable setting; service is excellent too. It's a good enough place that I wouldn't mind coming back here, but there's very little that would make me have an urge to return here specifically.",

You walk to the entrance and are instantly greeted by smiles and arm loads of menus. Whisked off to a comfy chair and well spaced tables. Great for keeping conversations private. The wine list and beautiful wine lockers are extensive and well done. There is food for everyone. Big meats eaters, fish peeps, vegans, vegetarians you all win. I know it\u2019s been done but the freshest of fresh tuna and avocado still makes me so happy as does a bowl of yummy gnocchi. I do like the portions here. They are large but not silly. Believe it or not I think this is a great date night when all the suits go home. It is quiet and dark so enjoy the vibe whenever you end up here. \nPlease follow @joannasable on instagram for more great restaurants",
