It clearly says on their website that they do and so as details why you need to see a pediatric dentist. They even asked why my child needs to be seen and did not give information ahead that they don\u2019t have pediatric dentist. I paid for something we did not need and already knew about my child\u2019s dental issues since we have already seen another dentist but not located in Toronto. Very frustrating.\n\n**Update** Edit- \nAfter a week from this review, the General Manager followed up on me regarding the issue and offered a refund. I was informed that she talked to their staff at King Street prior to calling me. She also informed me that their Pediatric Dentist is on maternity leave. (Which the Dentist who checked my child probably didn\u2019t know). I\u2019m rating this now a 4 star from a 1 star.",
