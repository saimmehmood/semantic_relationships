There wasn't so much as a hello just a blank stare.  I walked in asking if the  restaurant was kid friendly that translates to  \"can kids eat here?\" I was told  the music was about to get turned up so \"not really\"...but to my surprise there was already a family with 2 kids sitting in the patio. She was standoffish not engaging and just seemed bothered. I was never offered a high chair for my 2 year old i didn't bother to ask because \"not really\" gave me the impression that kids as young as mine don't eat there (btw saw their highchair collecting dust by the kitchen).  We got 2 different servers both were very kind but very forgetful whatever they forgot to bring out we didn't bother to remind them..that's just loss of revenue for them. As a business owner myself I can only say you're only as good as your team. Your longevity depends on your staff. Miss \"not really \" hostess needs an attitude check. 1 star for the decent food, 1 star for the great music.",

            "text": "My wife and I finally decided to try this place last weekend.\nIt was quite busy and there was a wait. The host seemed flustered and I think he was really overwhelmed.\nThere were other things that were slightly off: he took forever getting to taking our order and we had our menus off to the side for a while.\nIt took a while to get water. When our food arrived, we weren\u2019t even given cutlery yet.\nEverything was just very slow and off.\nThe food also fell flat for us. Maybe it\u2019s what we ordered (I had the caesar and a side of potato wedges and my wife ordered the spicy bap) but we weren\u2019t very happy with any aspect of our meal.\n\nMy wife and I eat out a fair bit and it just seemed like nothing was together which put a damper on everything.",

We were told there was a wait and when we were called back, 4 of us were seated at what seemed like a table for 2 people, but there was another group of 3 that was in the same boat so we let it slide.\nOur waitress was obviously very busy, but she took the time to set up and offer us a bigger table that sat us all more comfortably without us having to ask.\nAs far as service goes there was obviously no time for chit chat, but our waitress very knowledgeably answered all of our questions about the menu and told us the options for what we could get with different dishes.\nShe was prompt and courteous.\n\nThe food was really good, although they were out of a few things that we really wanted try.\n\nAll in all, will definitely be coming back!",
