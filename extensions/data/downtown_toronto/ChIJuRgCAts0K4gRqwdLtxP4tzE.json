Their website and app are really easy to use, you can set everything up online and they have lots of articles to learn more about money management. I've also called in to the relationship managers a few times, and they have been great to address my questions. Unlike a lot of the posts below, I had no trouble getting through to their line and speaking to someone right away. I highly recommend them for all your investment needs.",

Communication with them was terrible/non-existent, and I found their \"magazine\" written by, and targeted towards 15-25 year old people.  Which, I suppose, is their market.  I do love the idea of Wealth Simple. Getting younger people to start investing anything, even $50 is great.  Their fees for someone just starting out can't be beat, and they allow individuals to purchase fractional shares so weekly contributions can be set low.  However, this is not the platform if you have significant assets, are able to purchase whole shares regularly, or desire quick responses to your queries.",

I think there's a need for millennial users and financial advice that they could serve while adding benefit to their existing service.",
