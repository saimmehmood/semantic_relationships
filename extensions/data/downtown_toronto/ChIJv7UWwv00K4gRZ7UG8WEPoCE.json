            "text": "3.5 stars.  Nice spot to check out for a gift your someone special or yourself.\n\nShinola looks like any regular leather or watch store but there's an interesting history that goes beyond the gleaming glass cases filled with many masculine colours of leather bands.  I watched a video of how the original craftsmen specifically chose Detroit to create Shinola.  It was an effort to rebuild the manufacturing history and skills that seems to be fleeting in that city.  Another interesting tidbit, it wasn't just to build items they can sell but very high end products that require 'craftsmen' more than just plain manufacturing lines.\n\nThe Toronto store sits on one of the hippest corner ... Ossington and Queen.  Between the Shinola, Lululemon's men only concept store Local, Tiger of Sweden, and Toronto's only store outpost of Burton's Boards.  This spot is targetting the active, hip, and moneyed crowd.  Shinola definitely fits in.  \n\nThe store itself is nicely done up with a lot of showcases of their leather goods (journals, watches, bags), bicycles, and other little gifts.  The service here is personable without being overbearing.  If you need help, there's easily 5 people here to help you with your questions or concerns. There's no issue with asking them try on different watches and they're happy to do so.\n\nNow the only pause I had was the price...  these were heading into Gucci territory easily.  Though I do appreciate how it seems to be more focus on craft and personal touches to these watches, the prices do give me pause.  Most ones with a leather band were sitting at $800 and were very casual looking.  The metal bands ones had a bit more luxe look to them but easily pushed $1000+ and a few of the mens were at $1500+.  \n\nSo for those who like the history of Shinola or a casual look, this maybe more your territory especially if you have bigger wallets.  For me, I can appreciate their efforts but their style isn't quite me to easily put down my credit card for $800+.",

I have tried to make a purchase here twice--first, a handbag, and next, a backpack. Both times, in the midst of starting the transaction, I have been abandoned and ignored when a younger, more beautiful person walked into the store. Never mind that in both cases, I was the more likely and valuable sale! My advice is to steer clear, in case you don't pass the \"cool\" test of this pretentious place.",
