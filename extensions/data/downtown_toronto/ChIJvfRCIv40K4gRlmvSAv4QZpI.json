I am very strict with my teeth and getting the best care for them and I can honestly say I have never had a more thorough cleaning when I went for my first appointment. They play friends on the TV for you during your appointment and the chair is so comfortable/gently massages your back... AMAZING! on my second appointment to get my crown replaced I was terrified as I had a bad experience with my original crown. This office is amazing. The crown replacement went so smoothly and did not hurt at all!!!!! I was made to feel so comfortable by the dentist and his assistant as well. Highly recommend this place!",

It was great to get to an actual sense about the state of my oral hygiene and what I can do to improve it. They were also very in tune with my pain tolerance and have great bedside manners. Plus, you can watch Netflix while getting treated!",
