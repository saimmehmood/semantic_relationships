I was so exhausted afterwards but it was the best exhaustion  ever. I had such a breakthrough. You can never stop learning in acting. Just when you think you've got it...there's more and for that i thank you so much. Thank you for creating such a warm and SAFE environment in class as I continue to pursue my passion and dream!\nSincerely,\nMaxine",

It has the welcoming feel of creativity, and is all around artsy and inspiring, which pretty much sums up the great man who started and owns the studio, Tony Babcock and his staff. The dressing room towards the back of the studio gives you a feeling of putting on a play, and I just all around love it. I have great memories there that I'll always cherish, and I'm sure there will be many more to come. Highly recommend!",
